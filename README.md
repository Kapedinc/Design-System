# Design-System
When we designed the first KAPED OS in 2020, we wanted to create the best digital experience possible. We sought to create efficient and delightful moments for our users. Over time, our design systems have evolved -- but our core goal remains unchanged: to be beautiful in every single instance. What does "beautiful" mean? To us, it means being fast and efficient; making joyous experiences; working consistently; finding artistry; and going above expectations. Beauty is central to our mission, inspiring us to challenge ourselves and unlock what's possible. Our work blends art and product design together to solve problems, trigger emotions, and reach beyond imagination. Our design language connects all elements of KAPEDâ€™s diverse offerings -- from payments to issuing -- in an unconventional yet consistent manner. At the heart of every engineering solution we build lies a commitment to beauty.
